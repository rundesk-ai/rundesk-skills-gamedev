# Sources

Verified 12 August 2026. This package independently synthesizes public documentation, source code,
named-practitioner explanations, public failure reports, and anonymized first-hand project evidence.
It does not prescribe one engine, tile ratio, height grammar, sort constant, or picking algorithm for
all isometric games.

## Projection, inversion, and editor coordinates

- Unity,
  [Creating an Isometric Tilemap (2020.1)](https://docs.unity3d.com/2020.1/Documentation/Manual/Tilemap-Isometric-CreateIso.html),
  distinguishes its default dimetric cell ratio (`1, 0.5, 1`) from true isometric (`y = 0.57735`),
  documents parallel isometric layouts and Z-as-Y height, and demonstrates that a flat Y sorting axis
  orders stacked Z tiles incorrectly. The named numeric sort bias is Unity-specific and is not reused
  as a portable constant.
- Clint Bellanger,
  [Isometric Tiles Math](https://clintbellanger.net/articles/isometric_math/), derives one common
  diamond grid-to-screen transform and its algebraic inverse from half-tile basis vectors. This is
  named-practitioner teaching for a 2:1 convention, not proof that every game should use that ratio,
  handedness, origin, or rounding policy.
- Tiled,
  [Editing Tilesets](https://docs.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/editing-tilesets/) and
  [Working with Objects](https://docs.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/objects/), documents tile-object
  alignment, drawing offsets, and bottom-centre alignment as the unspecified default for isometric
  tile objects. This supports separating a world footpoint from bitmap bounds; projects must still
  honor explicit imported alignment rather than assuming Tiled's default.
- Tiled,
  [Working with Layers](https://docs.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/layers/) and the
  [TMX map format](https://docs.mapeditor.org/en/stable/reference/tmx-map-format/), documents that
  non-staggered isometric object coordinates use a projected coordinate space and that map orientation,
  render order, tile dimensions, offsets, and layer order are separate stored contracts. These are
  editor/file semantics, not a runtime renderer architecture.

## Height-aware picking and conservative bounds

- OpenTTD source at commit
  [`abf2843`, `landscape.h` projection functions](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/abf28430690ee05aaf4f81b20ac9f0e8d63f66ef/src/landscape.h#L81-L117)
  defines `RemapCoords`, flat `InverseRemapCoords`, and a separate height-aware inverse contract. It
  establishes a production source example where forward projection includes elevation and the flat
  inverse explicitly assumes `z == 0`; its integer scale and axis convention are OpenTTD-specific.
- OpenTTD source at the same commit,
  [`InverseRemapCoords2`](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/abf28430690ee05aaf4f81b20ac9f0e8d63f66ef/src/landscape.cpp#L121-L170)
  and
  [`GetPartialPixelZ`](https://github.com/OpenTTD/OpenTTD/blob/abf28430690ee05aaf4f81b20ac9f0e8d63f66ef/src/landscape.cpp#L238-L337),
  starts from the flat inverse, performs bounded fixed-point height sampling, approaches discontinuous
  foundations from behind so regions remain clickable, and derives extra map-edge allowance from the
  configured height limit. This supports height-aware picking, shared slope sampling, and derived cull
  margins. Its iteration counts, malus, slope catalogue, and clamping behavior are implementation
  evidence, not universal constants.

## Depth, occlusion, and rotation failures

- Shaun LeBron,
  [Drawing isometric boxes in the correct order](https://shaunlebron.github.io/IsometricBlocks/),
  derives projected-overlap and separating-axis dependencies for non-intersecting axis-aligned boxes,
  orders them topologically, demonstrates a dependency cycle, and discusses splitting/clipping or a
  depth buffer. This named-practitioner construction supports escalating beyond one scalar key; it does
  not directly cover intersecting volumes, arbitrary meshes, transparency, or a broad-phase strategy.
- OpenRCT2 issue
  [#22617](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/issues/22617) reproduces sloped wooden supports drawing
  over a diagonal track beneath them in a specific stacked crossing. It is public failure evidence that
  tile membership and nominal elevation alone do not settle multi-piece occlusion; it does not establish
  the package's proposed data schema.
- OpenRCT2 merged pull request
  [#25002](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/pull/25002) records a track drawing glitch caused by
  bounding-box differences across camera angles; the author notes one rotation happened to avoid the
  bug. It supports making bounds and ordering first-class in every orientation, but its exact track
  bounds and fix are asset-specific.
- OpenRCT2 issue
  [#18479](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/issues/18479) reproduces objects over water disappearing
  near the viewport bottom after tile-element reordering, and
  [#24805](https://github.com/OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2/issues/24805) records a backside tunnel occlusion/reveal
  failure. Together they support combined viewport-edge, stacked-layer, and orientation/reveal tests;
  open or historical issues are failure reports, not proof of a general solution.
- Microsoft,
  [Xbox Accessibility Guideline 109: Object clarity](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/xbox/accessibility/xbox-accessibility-guidelines/109),
  requires important game objects and interactive elements to remain identifiable and recommends
  assessing clarity in game context. It supports player-view composition checks rather than isolated
  sprite review. It does not define an isometric zoom set, projection, or sorting algorithm.

## Bounded workflow case study

- AAABench,
  [world-generation prompt at commit `5072a73`](https://github.com/ukanwat/aaabench/blob/5072a732b3ddd3d3ad95dfef2dc049b187d9d026/PROMPT.md#L834-L941),
  is a prescriptive Unreal-oriented benchmark prompt that asks builders to inspect generated output,
  take close views rather than relying on wide shots, and correct repeated defects at the generator.
  This package borrows only the multiscale inspection and trace-the-producing-rule heuristic, then
  constrains it with the independent projection, rotation, culling, and object-clarity evidence above.
  It does not treat AAABench's realism goal, scale, formulas, or production posture as universal
  authority, and no instructions or assets are copied from its bundled skills.

## Anonymized first-hand evidence

- Private source, tests, live-render contracts, and component postmortems from one 2026 2D isometric
  city-builder were inspected as first-hand evidence. A flat-plane inverse selected the wrong tile on
  raised and sloped terrain until drawing and picking shared one height sampler and topology; a
  height-derived cull expansion prevented raised far-edge holes; and hand-picked seam scenes repeatedly
  missed overlap combinations that an exhaustive adjacent-state matrix later exposed. These observations
  support the draw/pick parity, derived-cull, and exhaustive-proof defaults.
- In the same project, an offline reconstruction and numeric projection checks reported success while
  the live window showed separated terrain tiles caused by a pixel/point content-scale mismatch. This
  supports keeping live rendered inspection after mathematical tests.

The private evidence is anonymized: no project, person, repository, asset, or owner path is published.
It is one engine and one game, inspected on 12 August 2026, so it supplies practitioner failure evidence
rather than a universal benchmark or independently accessible reproduction.

## Good/bad mapping

- The one-basis/inverse pair applies Bellanger's algebra, OpenTTD's paired forward/flat inverse, and
  Tiled's explicit coordinate contracts. The complete reverse-transform pipeline is this catalog's
  conservative integration rule.
- The draw/pick shared-surface pair applies OpenTTD's height-aware inverse and slope sampler plus the
  anonymized mismatch/fix. The exact intersection method remains topology-dependent.
- The footpoint pair applies Tiled's isometric bottom-centre alignment and drawing-offset distinction.
  Calling bottom-centre a default, rather than a requirement, preserves the source's explicit override.
- The dependency-graph pair applies LeBron's partial-order construction and cycle counterexample, with
  OpenRCT2 #22617 as a shipped-world failure. Stable tie-breaking is a determinism conclusion, not a
  claim made by those sources.
- The rotation pair applies OpenRCT2 #25002 and the anonymized combined cull/order evidence. The remap
  table is algebra derived and round-trip checked for the coordinate convention documented in the
  reference, not copied from an engine.
- The multiscale composition matrix is this catalog's conservative integration rule. Xbox object
  clarity supports in-context inspection; OpenRCT2 failures support rotation, stacked-layer, and
  viewport-edge cases; AAABench contributes a bounded practitioner prompt that contrasts wide shots
  with close inspection. None establishes that three zoom samples are sufficient for every game, so
  projects must add camera states and semantic fixtures required by their actual player contract.
